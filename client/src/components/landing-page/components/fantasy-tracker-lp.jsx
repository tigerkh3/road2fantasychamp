// in postman we are able to access our private league's data by sending our league associated
// data in our request as cookies, this gives us a successful return from the api

// how can we get the data we want for our fantasy tracker?

// we mainly want to find out who we are currently playing and the match up spread

// boxscore and scoringperiod id both give us a new return on data, might be able to use this
// we can also just use matchupScore and search through the array for our teamId
